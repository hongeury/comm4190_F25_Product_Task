# COMM4190 Product Task: LLM-Powered Product Development & A/B Testing

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in product development, marketing, and evaluation. We developed two innovative snack products, generated marketing content using LLMs, and conducted A/B testing using LLMs as evaluators to test different website designs and messaging strategies.

## Project Goals

1. **Product Development**: Create two distinct snack products with compelling value propositions
2. **LLM Integration**: Leverage LLMs to generate product names, descriptions, slogans, and marketing content
3. **A/B Testing**: Use LLMs to evaluate and compare different website designs and messaging approaches
4. **Reflective Analysis**: Critically examine the benefits and limitations of using LLMs for product evaluation

## Key Takeaways

### LLM Capabilities in Product Development
- **Content Generation**: LLMs proved highly effective at generating diverse product names, slogans, and marketing copy tailored to different target audiences
- **Iterative Refinement**: The ability to generate multiple variations quickly enabled rapid iteration and exploration of creative concepts
- **Audience Targeting**: LLMs successfully adapted messaging for distinct audiences (e.g., newcomers vs. familiar users of plantain chips)

### A/B Testing with LLMs
- **Evaluation Consistency**: LLMs provided consistent evaluation frameworks for comparing website designs
- **Reflexive Analysis**: Using LLMs to both generate content and evaluate it created an interesting feedback loop
- **Limitations**: LLM-based A/B testing may not fully capture real consumer behavior, emotions, or purchasing decisions

### Project Insights
- The combination of visual product images and persuasive website copy is crucial for effective product presentation
- LLM-generated content benefits from human oversight to ensure authenticity and brand alignment
- A/B testing methodology using LLMs offers scalability but should be complemented with real user testing for production-ready products
